# Part 4: Civic Hacking

> "How does government become an open platform that allows people inside and outside government to innovate? How do you design a system in which all of the outcomes aren’t specified beforehand, but instead evolve through interactions between government and its citizens, as a service provider enabling its user community?"

> -- Tim O’Reilly, [Open Government](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html)
