# The Need for a Collaborative State

> The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.

This is a book about government and how we use new technologies and data to support the core functions of government.

Questions about how governments can most effectively and most efficiently use technology are not new, but they have become increasingly important since the early 1990's with the advent of the World Wide Web and the ensuing explosion in networked devices.

I began my very first job in government in 1993, the same year that the Mosaic web browser was released to the public. My experience working in 3 different state and local governments over the last 20 years has closely tracked some important developments in the world of government technology - the introduction of the web and Internet technologies in government; the rise e-Government and the creation of centralized government *web portals*, the rise of open data and the growth in government app contests and civic hacking.
