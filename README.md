# The Need for a Collaborative State

> The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.

This is a book about government and how we use new technologies and data to support the core functions of government.

Questions about how governments can most effectively and most efficiently use technology are not new, but they have become increasingly important since the early 1990's with the advent of the World Wide Web and the ensuing explosion in networked devices.

I began my very first job in government in 1993, the same year that the Mosaic web browser was released to the public. My experience working in 3 different state and local governments over the last 20 years has closely tracked some important developments in the world of government technology - the introduction of the web and Internet technologies in government; the rise e-Government and the creation of centralized government *web portals*, the rise of open data and the growth in government app contests and civic hacking.

Over all that time, governments have cemented a reputation as being inept when it comes to adopting new technologies and using them effectively. This ineptitude is taken as an article of faith in the world of civic technology and among those who would reform the ways that public sector acquires and uses technology.

But more often than not, faith in this belief is missing a fuller understanding for the reasons why governments face challenges in adopting new technologies. As I argue in Section 1, there are some very specific and easily identifiable processes that hinder the efficient adoption of technology by governments. These processes were constructed deliberately, to work in a specific way, often as a means of correcting other perceived issues. Understanding why these processes were constructed the way that they were is key to understanding how governments might improve their use of technology.

But looking beyond the mechanics of specific government processes, there are other factors - baked into the DNA of our democracy - that can make the efficient adoption of technology by governments more challenging.

## Government often seems complex

In the world of technology, complexity is often a function if a lack of uniformity. 

The [responsibility for specific government functions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/state-and-local-government) in our federalist system is divided between federal, state and local governments. 

* Federal system
* Number of governments

## Government can be slow

* decentralize power
* many of the things we value as strengthening democracy can make action slower - inclusiveness, transparency 

The unifying characteristic of these factors is that they were deliberately set up this way - the seeds of government's slow pace of action and complex structure were planted by our nation's founders. It's also worth noting that in many ways these characteristics of our democracy can be viewed as virtuous and beneficial.

In the modern world, however, these fundamental characteristics can work against the efficient adoption of technology. The pace of change in the world of technology has reduced from years to months to weeks.

The challenge we face a advocates of reform to the way that governments acquire, manage and use technology assets is in how we strike the balance between these fundamental concepts in our democracy and the need to operate differently. Do we concentrate decision making and power? Do we relax requirements to be inclusive and transparent? What are we willing to sacrifice to get better results.

I argue in this book that there is another way.

We are in the midst of a sea change in how governments operate and deliver services. We are seeing new partnerships forged between governments and outside actors who are able to innovate in ways that governments often find difficult. These partnerships are creating new opportunities for governments to leverage technology and better serve their citizens. We're still in the very early stages of this change, but the potential benefit for both governments and citizens is immense.

In the 21st Century and beyond, for governments to more effectively utilize technology to fulfill their mission, we need to construct a new state - a collaborative state.
